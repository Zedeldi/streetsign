# New Streetsign???

Attempt to rebuild streetsign using Django for the backend (for now) and
TypeScript + React for the front end (well, for the admin interface for now).

Ideally, the back end will be light enough to be able to be re-written in
something else if desired - but that's not a priority at the moment.

# STATE: PREALPHA!

Just learning and prototyping at the moment.
